# Topic: Security Benchmarking Tool
## Author: Balan Victor FAF-192
## Description: 
The goal of these Laboratory Works is to create a fully functional Security Benchmarking Tool
### Lab1: 
The objective is to be able to import the manually downloaded policies from a predefined trusted location, parse and understand the format of data within the imported policy and save the same set of policies under a different name within a structured form.
### Lab2:
Add the functionality to choose which options from the custom audit to run (by selecting or deselecting options), search by name for an option (via a search bar) and create and save a policy that contains only the selected options under the same name or
a different one.
### Lab 3: 
Add the functionalities to perform an audit of the workstation, using the options that were selected and output the results of the audit on screen.
### Lab 4-5: 
Add the functionality to enforce the selected policies and have the possibility to rollback to the initial settings.
### Lab 6: 
Create an application that would let you authorize into your account using SSO (Single Signo-On) with an identity provider and output data about the registered user.
### Lab 7: 
Create a MongoDB database with some secure data that can be accesses only from a secure application.
### Lab 8: 
Create an application that would perform an email confirmation.
